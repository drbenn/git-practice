        <h3>Random Notes</h3>

          <li>To see gitlab like branch chart in Github got to Insights > Network</li>

        <h2>Managing Branches:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>create branch with 'git branch feature1'</li>
          <li>switch between branches with 'git switch feature1'</li>
          <li>to delete branch, must not be in branch being deleted and use 'git branch -D feature1', the big -D is like --force and there is no coming back after</li>
          <li>To rename use -m which is for move/rename, you MUST be in the branch you are renaming and then do 'git branch -m new-name', where new name is the replacement branch name. May need change in code for suiteable commit and then an additional command of 'git push origin HEAD' as gitHub will not recognize the new branch name</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>For simple merge (feature branch with no addtl commits on master branch):</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>switch to branch receiving the feature branch, in this case, 'git switch main'</li>
          <li>merge feature branch INTO master branch, 'git merge feature1'... i did 'git merge renamed-branch'</li>
          <li>In the case for ex. branch 'SeachBar' was created with several commits, and after it was branched off 'main' branch added a few commits, however, updates to totally different files were complete in each branch, there will be no merge conflicts to validate, however, a merge comment will be necessary</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>For Merge Conflicts:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open files with merge conflicts</li>
        <li>Edit files to remove conflicts, content from both branches will be shown, you need to keep/replace what is necessary</li>
        <li>Remove the conflict 'markers' in the doc</li>
        <li>Add your changes and then make a commit</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VSC can be used to select one branch or the other with clickable options to select which branches edits to accept in the merge</strong></li>

        <h2>Git Stash - How to save uncommitted edits on new branch and then switch branch(bc cant switch branch bc uncommitted!)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If there are NO conflicts between moving branches, the uncommitted work will follow you to the switched to branch</li>
          <li>if there ARE conflicts, you will need to delete changes or you can stash</li>
            <ol>
              <li>If encounter this uncommitted conflict, just use 'git stash' (short for git stash save)</li>
              <li>Then later use 'git stash pop' to reapply the stashed changes to your working copy...which CAN be a different branch</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rebasing</h2>
        <h3>Two main ways to use rebase</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Alternate to merge</li>
          <li>As a cleanup tool</li>
          <li><span style="color:red">NEVER REBASE commits that have been shared with others(others created a branch off your feature branch)</span></li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Rebase adjusts the timeline and re-writes history.</li>
          <li>Instead of parallel commits between two branches, if you rebased a feature branch onto main, the feature commits would all be added to extend the HEAD(at the tip) of the main branch</li>
          <li>Instead of using a merge commit, rebasing rewrites history by creating new commits(after main HEAD) for each of the original feature branch commtis</li>
          <li>'git switch feature' and 'git rebase main' - you switch to branch merging in and you rebase the featuree into main branch</li>
          <li>End of Udemy course topic 142 has good visual</li>
          <li>YOU REBASE ONTO MASTER</li>
